There are three weekly group sessions available to help you complete the assignments. Attendance is not mandatory but recommended. However, all assignments are graded and not submitting them or submitting them after the deadline will give you no points.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this assignment is to get a basic understanding of the core concepts in object detection using convolutional neural networks. More specifically, this work focuses on the simpler problem of object localization, where each image contains a single object that should be spatially localized and classified. While object localization is simpler than object detection in the sense that object detection is more general as it allows for multiple objects per scene, object localization remains a rather avanced method, perfectly suited for our current level. This exercise consists of two parts:\n",
    "- To begin with, we will get familiar with the sliding window algorithm, and notice that applying a convolutional neural network sequentially to a specific set of windows within an image is in fact mathematically equivalent to passing the whole image as input for the convolutional neural network. We will in particular try to understand what parameters determine which set of windows will be processed by the convolutional sliding window algorithm and we will run a performance comparison between the sequential and convolutional implementations.\n",
    "- In a second part, we will implement in pytorch our own take on the object localization algorithm. For that purpose, the knowledge acquired in the first part of this assignment will be helpful, as we will try to implement object localization using a convolutional sliding window approach. In order for us to be able to train and test our network even on modest hardware, this exercise will have you work on a custom dataset: you will use the MNIST dataset as a backbone to generate new images with digits randomly placed and transformed, and each image will contain a single digit. While solving object localization on this custom dataset will be much easier than traditional object detection on large datasets such as COCO, it will still require clever vectorized coding if you hope to train your network in a reasonable amount of time !\n",

    "# Convolutional sliding window\n",
    "\n",
    "The sliding window algorithm refers to any procedure that applies a certain function (\"map\") to sliding windows within an image. In its typical forumaltion, this seems to be an inherently sequential algorithm: process the first window, then the second etc$\\dots$ assuming the function to apply on every window is a convolutional neural network, an interesting fact arises: the sequential implemention of sliding window for this convolutional neural network map becomes exactly equivalent to passing the whole image as input to the convolutional neural network. We will investigate this fact further in this section. Answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Watch Andrew's video about convolutional sliding window implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) What slight modification is needed on the convolutional neural network such that sequential and convolutional sliding window procedures for this convolutional neural network map become equivalent ?\n",
    "    - the 16 to 400 , with 5x5 filter conv layer needs to work like flatten()\n",
    "3) Reproduce the convolutional neural network from Andrew's video (1:20), and verify that for an input tensor with spatial dimension $16\\times 16$, convolutional sliding window for that convolutional neural network map is the same as a sequential sliding window with stride $2$ along both spatial dimension. You can for instance compute the norm of the difference between the output tensors from convolutional and sequential implementations and check that this norm is indeed $0.0$."

In a nutshell, we want to have a CNN that is able to locate and classify digits within input images with base dimensions $(h\\_in, w\\_in)$. Then, we use this CNN as the backbone mapping in a sliding window procedure, in order to be able to locate and classify digits within larger images with dimensions $(H\\_in, W\\_in)$ such that $H\\_in > h\\_in$ and $W\\_in > w\\_in$. In the first section, you learned how to perform this efficiently by converting the sequential sliding window procedure into a convolutional one. More specifically, you learned that passing directly the whole large image to the CNN mapping gives an output tensor whose spatial dimensions $(H\\_out, W\\_out)$ correspond to the number of sliding windows in the sequential procedure such that each cell is exactly the output of the CNN applied to the corresponding window. Moreover, you also are able to find the indices of these windows. \n",
