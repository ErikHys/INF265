    "\n",
    "Last week we saw how adding regularization to SGD could reduce overfitting. This week we will try to understand what happens exactly inside your model during the training process when applying the gradient descent method, with or without regularization and momentum. To do so we will simply implement first the backprogation algorithm which is how we compute the gradients and then the gradient descent, which is the trainable parameter update in response to this gradient.\n",

    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that when implementing more and more complex optimizers you start polluting a bit too much your training loop. We might prefer to seperate the code consisting in applying the gradient descent method and the code consisting in feeding your model with new inputs. This is what PyTorch does naturally. Indeed, we instantiate an optimizer (e.g. optim.SGD) with all its parameters, (learning rate, momentum, weight_decay, etc) and then we simply need to call ``optimizer.step()``  and ``optimizer.zero_grad()`` in our training loop independently of the optimization method used and of its parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to how we defined our custom neural network in Pytorch, we will create a class to define our custom optimizer. But instead of inheriting the ``nn.Module`` class, we will inherit the [torch.optim.Optimizer](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer). As written in the documentation, it is simply the \"Base class for all optimizers\". Keeping the ``nn.Module`` comparison, instead of having to implement a ``forward`` method (regardless of our model) we will have to implement a [step](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer.step) method (regardless of the optimization method chosen )\n",
